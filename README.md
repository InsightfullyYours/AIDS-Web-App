# AIDS-Web-App
This is the source code for a webapp that I wrote as a submission to the Insight Health Data Science program.  
It's a fairly simple one that can be found at:    http://insightfullyyours.pythonanywhere.com/

The username and password are both currently "Insight" (without quotes) if you'd like to play around with it a bit.

My project analyses data from the AIDS Crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.  There has been extensive journalistic and artistic 
coverage of this period in American history; however, as a data scientist, I wanted to interpret and analyze the period 
through a primary source data set.  I downloaded the publically available data on the AIDS crisis from the CDC WONDER database, 
and explored the scope of the crisis using original analysis and visualizations.  My data is a subset of the full data set, but 
I found that the numbers were, for me, a more viscerally affecting portrait of the AIDS crisis than I had seen in other sources.

It consists of both a analysis I performed on the entire database (all code at https://github.com/InsightlyYours/AIDSDatabaseAnalysis), described, with figures and text, in a standard website as well as an interactive area that users 
can explore.  The interactive area allows the user to select two locations from the AIDS database and 
it will automatically generate plots that compare the AIDS crisis in those two location.

It's pretty exciting!  Check it out!
