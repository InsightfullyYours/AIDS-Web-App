These are the html templates for all the pages in the web app.  They are written in the Flask framework with html.
They include all the my analysis of the overall database in text form, as well as links to the figures in the assets/images/ subfolder. 
This is hosted on www.pythonanywhere.com, which is why the code locates them at /static/images.  I have that mapped to my assets subfolder.
